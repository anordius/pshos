# A REVIEW OF STATISTICS USING R 
```{r}
#| echo: false

source("_common.R")
```

Refer to @hanck2021introduction for more details. Parts reviewed are:

i. Estimation of unknown population parameters
ii. Hypothesis testing
iii. Confidence intervals

```{r}
#| label: Packages to use
# dplyr - for data manipulation
# MASS - a collection of functions for applied statistics 
# rio - for data import and export
pacman::p_load(dplyr, MASS)
```

## Estimation of the Population Mean
```{r}
# plot the chi_12ˆ2 distribution
curve(dchisq(x, df=12),
  from = 0,
  to = 40,
  ylab = "Density",
  xlab = "Hourly earnings in Euro")
```
```{r}
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)
# sample from the chi_12ˆ2 distribution, use only the first observation
rsamp <- rchisq(n = 100, df = 12)
rsamp[1]
```

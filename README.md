Since 01 October 2024, I have been developing this book titled "Practical Statistics: Hands on Skills", with to now seven modules.
The aim is to help people working with different kinds of data to easily get insights from the data they are having. I am not sure when it will be available / ready for the public, but most of the contents in it, i do use in training different people and have proven to be very effective.

The future is promising, get yourself ready.

Welcome!
